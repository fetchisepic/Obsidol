multitool for all things revolving meta

*DO NOT* run obsidol.py; run the .bat file (Obsidol.bat) because windows loads your path inside cmd but not python environments (adb will not work correctly if u run the .py)

# Requirements 
adb platform tools installed and put in your systems PATH (https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)
python 3.11.x or higher 
setup.bat ran
